## ‚ùì AMA TALKING POINTS

**Q: Why start on BSC instead of Polygon?**

A: "BSC is where the massive growth is happening right now. Binance's ecosystem, DeFi activity, and user base make it perfect for reaching anime fans who are already in crypto. Plus, we maintain the same ultra-low fees and speed Polygon users loved."

**Q: What makes NAKAMA different from anime-themed coins?**

A: "We're not just themed - we actually reward friendship and community building. 90% of taxes go back to holders, and you earn NAKAMA for connecting with friends and making group purchases. That's unique in the crypto space."

**Q: When will NAKAMA hit major exchanges?**

A: "Q1 2026 for tier-2 exchanges like KuCoin and [Gate.io](http://Gate.io). Q2-Q3 2026 we're targeting Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. We're building real utility first - the listings follow naturally."

**Q: Is this a rug pull?**

A: "No. Our contract is being professionally audited, we've locked liquidity for 6+ months, and we're focused on actual anime partnerships, not quick hype. Check our CoinGecko listing and join our community - we're transparent about everything."

**Q: How do I earn rewards?**

A: "Multiple ways: Hold NAKAMA and earn staking rewards (15-25% APY). Connect with friends and earn friendship points. Buy with 3+ friends and get 10-20% discounts. Support anime creators directly. It's designed to reward genuine participation."

**Q: What's your market opportunity?**

A: "800+ million anime fans globally, $31 billion anime industry growing 9.8% yearly. If we capture just 1% of active spenders, that's 2 million users. We're not competing with Bitcoin - we're creating a new category."

**Q: Why should anime fans care about crypto?**

A: "Currently, there's no global anime economy. Streaming fees are high, creators don't get paid fairly, merchandise is fragmented. NAKAMA fixes this by letting fans support creators directly, earn rewards, and build a real community economy around shared passions."

## ‚ùì AMA TALKING POINTS

**Q: Why start on BSC instead of Polygon?**

A: "BSC is where the massive growth is happening right now. Binance's ecosystem, DeFi activity, and user base make it perfect for reaching anime fans who are already in crypto. Plus, we maintain the same ultra-low fees and speed Polygon users loved."

**Q: What makes NAKAMA different from anime-themed coins?**

A: "We're not just themed - we actually reward friendship and community building. 90% of taxes go back to holders, and you earn NAKAMA for connecting with friends and making group purchases. That's unique in the crypto space."

**Q: When will NAKAMA hit major exchanges?**

A: "Q1 2026 for tier-2 exchanges like KuCoin and [Gate.io](http://Gate.io). Q2-Q3 2026 we're targeting Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. We're building real utility first - the listings follow naturally."

**Q: Is this a rug pull?**

A: "No. Our contract is being professionally audited, we've locked liquidity for 6+ months, and we're focused on actual anime partnerships, not quick hype. Check our CoinGecko listing and join our community - we're transparent about everything."

**Q: How do I earn rewards?**

A: "Multiple ways: Hold NAKAMA and earn staking rewards (15-25% APY). Connect with friends and earn friendship points. Buy with 3+ friends and get 10-20% discounts. Support anime creators directly. It's designed to reward genuine participation."

**Q: What's your market opportunity?**

A: "800+ million anime fans globally, $31 billion anime industry growing 9.8% yearly. If we capture just 1% of active spenders, that's 2 million users. We're not competing with Bitcoin - we're creating a new category."

**Q: Why should anime fans care about crypto?**

A: "Currently, there's no global anime economy. Streaming fees are high, creators don't get paid fairly, merchandise is fragmented. NAKAMA fixes this by letting fans support creators directly, earn rewards, and build a real community economy around shared passions."
