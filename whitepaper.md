## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Anime Community Economics

**1. Fragmented Fan Communities**
- Anime fans are scattered across multiple platforms with no unified economy
- Limited ways to monetarily support favorite creators and content
- No rewards for community building and positive engagement
- Lack of incentives for bringing friends into the anime ecosystem

**2. High Transaction Costs**
- Traditional payment methods charge 3-8% fees for digital content
- International transactions face currency conversion complexities
- Micropayments for tips and small purchases are economically unfeasible
- Cross-border creator support is expensive and slow

**3. Missing Social Economics**
- No financial benefits for introducing friends to anime
- Group purchases don't receive collaborative discounts
- Community contributions go unrewarded
- Social connections lack economic incentives

**4. Creator Monetization Barriers**
- High platform fees reduce creator revenue by 30-50%
- Payment delays of 30-90 days hurt creator cash flow
- Limited direct fan-to-creator payment options
- No system for micro-sponsorships and community funding
